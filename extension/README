The majority of the extension can be edited easily, however the Content Script
is written in Google Closure and thus needs to be built.

To build, run the following lines to compile the code:
sudo closure-library/closure/bin/build/closurebuilder.py --root=closure-library/ --root=js/ --namespace="greenday.extension.App" --output_mode=compiled --compiler_jar=compiler.jar > js/content_script.js

You should then deploy it to the Chrome Webstore.

When making changes to the Chrome Webstore make sure you increase the version
number inside of the manifest.json.

If you change the URL of the web app you will need to update it inside of both
the app.js, background.js and manifest.json file.

If there are major changes to the YouTube UI you will also need to change the
extension.

If for some reason the closure-library does not exist. Then make sure you
download it using the line:
git clone https://github.com/google/closure-library


Enjoy the extension!
